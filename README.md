# Keeb Deals Public Data Information

This is another public repository to contribute in [Keeb Deals](https://keeb.deals/) to help to mantain updated all the more static data what doesn't need to be hardcoded or develop a big feature in the website to read.  
This information are just for read and populate collections in the database for a few endpoints or maybe just for internal logic in the APIs.

If you're developing something be free to fork this and use it for your projects.

## Actual information
### Vendors/Shop
All type of vendors around the world, small shop or bigger shop, all be treat equaly. The order of the showcase inside the website will be totally different from these files so don't worry if you're shop is at the bottom in the list. _The actual logic to decide what list will show is going to be the nearest of the user_

# CONTRIBUTE

- Create a Pull Request adding your store at the bottom of the list 
    - You have data structure in `docs/` of what type of static data you're looking for to .
    - If you need to do some changes in your store for any reason, just edit your element, nothing else.

- If everything is okey we will merge this to `master` and will be automatically uploaded to the database and will be online in a few minutes :)
